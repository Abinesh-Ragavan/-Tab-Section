              <h3>Step 1</h3>
              <p>
        Spend time with your child. How a father spends his time reveals to his child what is important to him. Kids grow up
        quickly and the time to bond is now. There are plenty of fun ways to spend family time with children.
        <br>
        Discipline with love and positive parenting. All children need positive guidance and discipline, not as punishment, but
        to set reasonable limits. Dads should remind children of the consequences of their actions and positively acknowledge
        desirable behavior. Fathers who discipline in a calm and fair manner show love for their children.
        Be your childs role model. Whether they realize it or not, fathers are role models to their kids. A girl who spends time
        with a loving father grows up knowing she deserves to be treated with respect by boys and she learns what to look for in
        a partner. Fathers teach boys and girls what is important in life by demonstrating honesty, humility and responsibility.</p></div>

          Earn the right to be heard. Fathers should begin conversations with their children about important topics when they are
          very young so that difficult subjects will be easier to handle as they get older. Take time for listening to your childs
          ideas and problems.
          Be your childs teacher. To be a good father, teach your children about right and wrong and encourage them to do their
          best. See that your children make good choices. Involved fathers use everyday examples to help children learn the basic
          lessons of life.
          Eat together as a family. An important part of healthy family life is bonding through family meals. It gives kids the
          chance to talk about what they are doing and want to do. It is also a good time for fathers to listen and be involved.
          It provides a structure for families to be together each day.

              <h3>Step 3</h3>
              <p>
              Read to your child. In a modern world dominated by television and internet, it is important that fathers make the effort
              to read to their children in order to grow lifelong readers. Begin reading when they are very young and as they get
              older, encourage them to read on their own. Instilling a love of reading is one of the best ways to ensure children will
              have a lifetime of literacy and personal and career growth.
              Respect the other parent of your child. Parents who respect each other and demonstrate mutual respect to their children,
              provide a secure environment for them. When children see parents respecting each other, they are more likely to feel
              that they are also accepted and respected within the father-child relationship.
              Seek involvement early. Show interest early by understanding a fathers role during pregnancy or the adoption or
              surrogacy process and gently touch, play, hold and talk to your infant child. When fathers are involved, they send the
              clear and emphatic message: "I want to be your father. I am interested in you and we have a relationship that is
              important to me."
